Curvetopia is a Python project that identifies, regularizes, and beautifies 2D curves, turning line art into cubic BÃ©zier curves. It includes techniques for shape regularization, symmetry detection, and curve completion, with visualization tools for inspecting results. Ideal for refining hand-drawn shapes and doodles into polished curves.
